# AI CONTEXT

## Project Goal
Understand and implement custom shaders in React Three Fiber (R3F), specifically focusing on extending `ShaderMaterial`, defining uniforms, and updating them dynamically using the `useFrame` hook for animations.

## Current State
Initial research on R3F custom shaders completed. Information gathered covers:
- How to `extend` `THREE.ShaderMaterial` to use it as a declarative JSX component.
- The role and definition of uniforms in passing data from JavaScript to GLSL.
- The use of `useFrame` and `useRef` to dynamically update uniform values for animations.

## Key Decisions
- Utilize `@react-three/drei`'s `shaderMaterial` factory for simplified `ShaderMaterial` creation.
- Employ `useRef` to maintain stable references to material instances for `useFrame` updates.
- Leverage `delta` from `useFrame` for frame-rate independent animations.

## Recent Progress
- Conducted web search for "React Three Fiber extend shaderMaterial useFrame update uniforms 2024" and summarized findings.

## Next Steps
- Implement a basic R3F application demonstrating a custom `ShaderMaterial` with animated uniforms.
- Add TypeScript types for the custom material.
- Explore more complex shader effects and uniform types.
